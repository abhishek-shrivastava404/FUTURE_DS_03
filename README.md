📊 Student Satisfaction and Feedback Analysis Using Survey Data

📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes student feedback to understand satisfaction levels, teaching effectiveness, and areas for improvement in academic courses.
Two structured survey datasets are used to perform descriptive analysis and visualization, helping convert raw feedback into actionable insights.
The project focuses on clarity, correctness, and real-world applicability, rather than complex or unnecessary modeling.

🎯 Objectives
1. Analyze individual student feedback on teaching and course attributes
2. Study overall satisfaction trends using aggregated survey data
3. Identify factors influencing course recommendation
4. Provide data-driven recommendations for academic improvement
---

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
1. Python
2. Google Colab
3. pandas – data cleaning and manipulation
4. matplotlib & seaborn – data visualization
---

📈 Analysis Performed
🔹 Individual Feedback Analysis

1. Average score per teaching attribute
2. Correlation analysis to identify factors influencing course recommendation
3. Visualization using bar charts and correlation heatmaps

🔹 Aggregated Satisfaction Analysis

1. Overall rating distribution (1–5)
2. Sentiment inference using Likert-scale mapping:
4–5 → Positive
3 → Neutral
1–2 → Negative
3. Course-wise satisfaction percentage
4. Stacked bar chart showing rating distribution per course
---

📊 Visualizations Included

1. Bar charts (average scores, rating distribution, course satisfaction)
2. Pie chart (overall sentiment distribution)
3. Correlation heatmap
4. Stacked bar chart (course-wise rating distribution)
---

🔍 Key Insights

1. Teaching clarity and doubt resolution strongly influence course recommendation
2. Overall student satisfaction is high, but specific areas such as course structuring and assignment difficulty require improvement
3. Aggregated satisfaction trends align with individual student perceptions

✅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates how structured student feedback data can be effectively analyzed using simple statistical techniques and visualization.
By combining individual responses with aggregated survey results, institutions can gain meaningful insights to support data-driven academic decisions.
